        A set is a collection of well defined and unique elements. Sets are generally denoted by capital letters and the elements of a set are cased within a pair of curly brackets.<br><br>
        Example: A = {1,2,3} is a set because each of the element is unique and well defined however A = {1, 2, 2, 3} is not a set because the element 2 is repeated, and therefore the elements are no longer unique to each other.
