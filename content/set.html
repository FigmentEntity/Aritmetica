        In our day to day lives, we use the term "set" to refer to a collection of items, for example, a set of plates, a set of clothes, etc. In general it refers to a collection of items of similar nature. Well, the set in mathematics is also used to refer to a collection of items who are all related to one another. The set in mathematics is very similar but not exact because in mathematics, the elements or items of a set should all be unique and universally accepted. In other words, the elements in a set do not repeat and the elements should be universally accepted. Sets are denoted by capital letters and curly braces are used to hold the elements of a set.<br><br> (A = {1,2,3} -> Set A whose elements are the first 3 counting numbers.s)<br><br>
        Example: Lets say, you were given this, A = {1,2,2,3}. Now, is A a set? The answer is no as the element 2 repeats. For A to be a set, all its elements should be unique i.e A should equal to {1,2,3}. Again, if I were asked to create set B whose elements are 3 best animes, the set I would make would be {Bleach, Megalobox, Samurai Champloo}. But, the set B I came up with would be completely different from the set B you might come up with because we both have a different taste in animes. Now, this is a problem because how can one set have two different collection of elements? The answer is, the elements of the set is not well defined. So, set B is also not a set as its elements changes from person to person. In other words, there are no universally accepted 3 best animes. But, If I ask you to make a set called C which contains all the planets in the solar system, then it will, no matter who you ask to create this set, have the  elements  {Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune}, the 8 planets of the solar system that are universally accepted. If anyone answers differently, they're a massive donkey.

        1.3 Representation of set
         </div>
            <p class="text">There are 3 distinct ways to represent the items or elements of a set, till now we have been making use of roster form to represent the elements of a sets</p>
     
             <p class="text">     
                i. Roster/Tabular form: In this form, the elements of a set are enclosed in a pair of curly braces. A = {1,2,3,4,5} <br><br>
                ii. Set builder/Property form: In this form, the elements are not given to us directly. As the name suggests, we have to build the set by extracting elements from a given condition. A = {x : 0 < x < 3, x ∈ N} which is read as, "Set A has elements x such that x is less than 3 but greater than 0 and x belongs to the set of natural numbers. So, A = {1,2,3}." You will be primarily using the symbols discussed in 1.2 here.<br><br>
                iii.Visual form: This method makes use of venn diagrams to display the elements of a set. For example, if A = {1,2,3} then to represent it in visual form, we would need to draw an oval and name it the same as the set i.e A and write the elements inside the oval.<br>

            1.4 Types of sets
        </div>
        <p class="text">Sets can be differed into various subtypes on the basis of the number of elements they hold.</p>
        <p class="text">
            i. Finite sets: Sets with defined end points. Example: A = {x : 0 < x < 5} i.e {1,2,3,4} <br><br>
            ii. Infinite sets: Sets with no defined end point. Example: {x : x ∈ N} i.e {1,2,3,...,∞}<br><br>
            iii. Void/Null/Empty sets: Sets with no elements. They are denoted by { }[empty curly braces] or Φ[phi]. Example: My love life i.e { }<br><br>
            iv. Singleton set: Sets with only one element. Example: {x : 0 < x < 2} i.e {1}

        <p class="text">The following alphabets are used to denote various sets of number systems. These are useful as they can be called upon in set builder forms to denote what number system the elements belong to. </p>

            i. N : Used to denote the infinite Natural number set. <br><br>

            1.6 Relation between sets
        </div>
        <p class="text">Two or more sets can be related to each other on the basis of the elements they hold.</p>
        <p class="text">
            i. Subsets: If the all the elements of set A is present in set B, then set A would be the subset of set B. Denoted by ⊆.<br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,1,4}, then A ⊆ B
            <br><br>
            ii. Equal sets: If set A is the subset of B and vice versa, the we can say that A and B are equal sets. Denoted by =.<br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {1, 2}. Here, A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, so, A = B.
            <br><br>
            iii. Disjoint sets: If set A and set B have no common elements at all, then we can say that they are disjoint sets. 
            <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {Barrack, Obama}
            <br><br>
            iv. Universal set: Sets contaning all the relevant elements to a question is referred to as Universal sets. Essentially its the daddy of all sets. Denoted by U. 
            <br><br>
            v. Intersecting set: If there are common elements between set A and set B, then they are referred to as intersecting sets. Denoted by ∩. <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {2, 4}. The two sets have 2 in common so they're intersecting sets.
            <br><br>
            vi. Power sets: The set including all possible subsets of set A along with itself and a null set is termed power set. Denoted by P(). <br>
            -Example: A: {1, 2}, then P(A) = {{},{1},{2},{1,2}} <br><br>

        <p class="text">
            i. Union: The new set formed from the sum of two sets. Denoted by U and expressed by {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B} <br>
            -Example: A{1,2,3} U B{2,4,5} would be AUB{1,2,3,4,5}. Common elements are written once and ignored.
            <br><br>
            ii. Intersection: The new set formed from the common elements of two sets. Denoted by ∩ and expressed by {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B } <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} ∩ B = {2, 3} would be A∩B{2}

            iii. Difference: The new set containing only elements of only set A excluding the elements of set B. Denoted by - and expressed by {x : x ∈ A but x ∉ B}<br>
            -Example: A{2,3,5} - B{3,4} would be A-B = {2,5}
            <br><br>
            iv. Complement: The new set contaning all elements except set that is complemented. Denoted by Ā/A<sup>c</sup>/A<sup>'</sup> and expressed by {x : x ∈ U but x ∉ A}<br>
            -Example: U = {x : x ∈ N} and A = {1,2,3}. So, the complement of A would be Ā{4,5,6,..∞}
            <br><br>
            v. Symmetrical difference: The new set formed from the differences between two sets. Denoted by Δ[Delta] and expressed by {x : x ∈ (A-B) or x ∈ (B-A)} <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2,3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Then, the symmetrical difference of the sets would be (A-B)U(B-A) i.e {1,2}U{4,5}. So, A Δ B would be {1,2,4,5}. <br><br>
