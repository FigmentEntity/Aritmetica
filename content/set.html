        A set is a collection of well defined and unique elements. Sets are generally denoted by capital letters and the elements of a set are cased within a pair of curly brackets.<br><br>
        Example: A = {1,2,3} is a set because each of the element is unique and well defined however A = {1, 2, 2, 3} is not a set because the element 2 is repeated, and therefore the elements are no longer unique to each other.

            i. Subsets: If the all the elements of set A is present in set B, then set A would be the subset of set B. Denoted by ⊆.<br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {2,3,1,4}, then A ⊆ B
            <br><br>
            ii. Equal sets: If set A is the subset of B and vice versa, the we can say that A and B are equal sets. Denoted by =.<br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {1, 2}. Here, A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, so, A = B.
            <br><br>
            iii. Disjoint sets: If set A and set B have no common elements at all, then we can say that they are disjoint sets. 
            <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {Barrack, Obama}
            <br><br>
            iv. Universal set: Sets contaning all the relevant elements to a question is referred to as Universal sets. Essentially its the daddy of all sets. Denoted by U. 
            <br><br>
            v. Intersecting set: If there are common elements between set A and set B, then they are referred to as intersecting sets. Denoted by ∩. <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} and B = {2, 4}. The two sets have 2 in common so they're intersecting sets.
            <br><br>
            vi. Power sets: The set including all possible subsets of set A along with itself and a null set is termed power set. Denoted by P(). <br>
            -Example: A: {1, 2}, then P(A) = {{},{1},{2},{1,2}} <br><br>

            i. Union: The new set formed from the sum of two sets.Denoted by U and expressed by {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B} <br>
            -Example: A{1,2,3} U B{2,4,5} would be AUB{1,2,3,4,5}. Common elements are written once and ignored.
            <br><br>
            ii. Intersection: The new set formed from the common elements of two sets. Denoted by ∩ and expressed by {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B } <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2} ∩ B = {2, 3} would be A∩B{2}
            <br><br>
            iii. Difference: The new set containing only elements of only set A excluding the elements of set B. Denoted by - and expressed by {x : x ∈ A but x ∉ B}<br>
            -Example: A{2,3,5} - B{3,4} would be A-B = {2,5}
            <br><br>
            iv. Complement: The new set contaning all elements except set that is complemented. Denoted by Ā/A<sup>c</sup>/A<sup>'</sup> and expressed by {x : x ∈ U but x ∉ A}<br>
            -Example: U = {x : x ∈ N} and A = {1,2,3}. So, the complement of A would be Ā{4,5,6,..∞}
            <br><br>
            v. Symmetrical difference: The new set formed from the differences between two sets. Denoted by Δ and expressed by {x : x ∈ (A-B) or x ∈ (B-A)} <br>
            -Example: A = {1,2,3} and B = {3, 4, 5}. Then, the symmetrical difference of the sets would be (A-B)U(B-A) i.e {1,2}U{4,5}. So, AΔB would be {1,2,4,5}. <br><br>
